LAB 9 https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/023ZrtDrV: for this assingment I pieced together parts of different projects to complete the task. Because of this I will just upload the final product and not the three steps. I already had a sprite that I wanted to use and the code itself is very similar to my A5Q1 code. So after modifiying that I was left with a sketch that draws 50 faces bouncing around a screen at varying speeds.
